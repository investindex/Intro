# A beginner's guide to investing

The goal here is a practical explanation of how a US citizen can invest money with a long-term approach. Many hyperlinks to accessible resources are included to make it easy to learn more than is presented in the text. My view is that many people delay investing for a few reasons: (1) they know loss is possible and fear it; (2) they don’t fully appreciate the immense long-term benefits of wise investment; and/or (3) they don’t know how to start investing or even researching, because there are too many options.

This document will offer a starting point to resolve those obstacles with highly concrete suggestions for investment. It will explore how individuals can personalize their distribution of investments along the spectrum of low to high risk. A number of general guidelines are also provided for how to structure your investments in the context of other aspects of personal finance. At the end is a list of important vocabulary with links. This document doesn’t contain all the information needed to start investing, so the list is intended to provide an idea of the concepts you should understand before you start.
