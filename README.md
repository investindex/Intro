# A beginner's guide to investing

The goal here is a practical explanation of how a US citizen can invest money with an evidence-based, long-term approach. My view is that many people delay investing for a few reasons: (1) they know [loss is possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DT7bX-B1Mg&ab_channel=HubertFarnsworth) and fear it; (2) they don’t fully appreciate the immense long-term benefits of wise investment; or (3) they mistakenly think investing is an activity that demands ongoing research and stressful decision-making about which companies to invest in. I think many people are hesitant to even start researching because there are simply too many options, which implies that there are many ways to make the wrong decisions.

This document will offer a starting point to resolve those obstacles with highly concrete [suggestions](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md) for investment. It will explore how individuals can personalize their distribution of investments along the [spectrum of low to high risk](https://github.com/investindex/Risk). Specific topics like [planning for retirement](https://github.com/investindex/Retirement) and [tax-advantaged accounts](https://github.com/investindex/TaxAdv) are covered. At the end is a [list of resources and important vocabulary](https://github.com/investindex/Vocab) with links. This document doesn’t contain every granular piece of information you might need, so the list is intended to provide an idea of the concepts you should understand before you start.

Before you begin reading, you may want to start with some introductory material.

[This series of ten short videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arz_9WX-pn0&list=PLENfNwrAryOiK4QF3Ot8PZdZ-Vcx07HAP) slowly introduces the basic concepts of investing and assumes zero prior knowledge. I've created a YouTube playlist of the videos at that link. (Two videos in the series are skipped deliberately, because they contain descriptions that don't apply to the investments in this guide.)

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_7F5N3ByQ) is a great explanation of the principles of financial markets and the approach to investing that will be applied here. Even those with some knowledge about investing will benefit from the discussion.

You can see the descriptions of each section below, as well as my estimate of how long each section takes to read at a slow speed suitable for processing new concepts. Throughout the guide, many hyperlinks to accessible resources are included to make it easy to learn more than is presented in the text. You may want to click on them as you read, or return to them afterward. The time estimates include only the main text, and not the time taken to click to the hyperlinks or read the footnotes. The current total, excluding the advanced topics, is less than 3 hours.
